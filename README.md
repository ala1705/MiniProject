# MiniProject source code and supplementary material
This repository contains supplementary material for a MiniProject "Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Modelling of Within-Host Dynamics of _Salmonella enterica_ infection"

Source code is written in Matlab (requires proprietary Matlab software to run), or in Eidos and open-source SLiM software is needed (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
