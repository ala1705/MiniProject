# MiniProject source code and supplementary material
This repository contains supplementary material for a MiniProject "Multi-scale spatial models of _Salmonella enterica_ within-host infection dynamics"

Source code is written in Matlab (requires proprietary Matlab software to run), and in Eidos and open-source SLiM software is needed (https://messerlab.org/slim/).
